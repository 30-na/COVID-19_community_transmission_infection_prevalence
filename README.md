Evaluating COVID-19 community transmission risk levels to reflect infection prevalence

## COVID-19 community transmission  
Community Transmission refers to measures of the presence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

### COVID-19 transmission levels Indicators:    
1. New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days.
